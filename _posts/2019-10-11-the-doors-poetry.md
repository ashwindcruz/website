In 2019, I worked with [Chris](https://christegho.github.io/about/) and [Zach](https://zachblas.info/) on a project Zach
orchestrated called [The Doors](http://www.zachblas.info/works/the-doors/).

This was an extremely fun project! We generated lots of gan videos with a small amount of data and you can watch these

We also used GPT 2 to combine the poetry of Jim Morrison and recent pharmaceutical literature on nootropics.
As strange as that might sound, let me assure you that the results were even more fun and trippier that you can imagine!
