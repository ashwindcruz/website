How do computers make decisions?
If a computer looked at an image of me, how sure would it be in saying that I was in the image?
What would it think of me? Why would it think that?
As we become more and more dependent on the decisions made by computers, these questions grow in import.

In 2019, I helped Shinji with a project that explored this particular issue.
We took a blank white slate and slowly started adding pixels to make up Shinji's face while running a facial
recognition algorithm on the changing image.
At some point, after the introduction of a single pixel, the computer suddenly saw Shinji!
It's a little disconcerting if you think about it, being seen or being invisible, all hinging on a single pixel.
