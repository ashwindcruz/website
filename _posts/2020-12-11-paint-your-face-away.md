Sometimes you put a piece of information online and you don't think much of it.
But behind the scenes, others are collecting that information and trying to make a buck of it.
That was the case with Clearview AI who scraped faces from a range of websites,
trained a facial recognition model with these faces, and then started selling groups like law enforcement
use of their model.
Aside from all the biases that I'm sure such a model would encode, there was also the issue that
Clearview AI never asked for permission when using these faces.

In 2020, I advised Shinji on his work Paint Your Face Away, a project that critisized this kind of malicious behaviour
and also tried to provide users a way to fight back. Shinji developed a website where you could digitally paint an image
and examine if your efforts would prevent your face from being recognized as well, a face.

You can try it out for yourself at this [link](https://paintyourfaceaway.net/index.html).
This work was also accepted at a 2020 Neurips Workshop and you can read more about that [here](http://www.aiartonline.com/art-2020/shinji-toya/).
