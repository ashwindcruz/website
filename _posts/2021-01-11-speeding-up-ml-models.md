At Calipsa, we're always looking for ways to speed up our development cycle.

At the start of 2021, a project I had been working on for a couple of months finally paid of.
I had finally got a gpu model to successfully work on a tpu while maintaing the performance.
Using a tpu meant that I could reduce the training time by 90% and I also reduced the cost of training by 85%!

Tpus can be quite finicky but I'm glad to have finally cracked the code here and I'm looking forward to using tpus a
lot more in the future and saving time and money.
