Hi there, I'm Ash!

I spend my time as a machine learning engineer, primarily for Calipsa but also across a broad range of other projects.
You can see examples of my work across this site.
Machine learning aside, you'll also find my blogs on this site. While some of these are related to machine learning (whoops!),  a good deal of them are summaries of books I've found
really interesting!
